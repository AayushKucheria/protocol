# Server protocol
This tiny project showed me that I could connect two separate things over the internet. I hadn't done anything like this before, so this was a powerful idea for me. 

So even though I've nothing to brag about in this project (except fro the misspelled "for" - no not this one), protocol did introduced me to the idea of remote connections which has been an early turning point.
